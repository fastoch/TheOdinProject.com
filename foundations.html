        <!--NESTING AND INDENTATION-->
        <p>You may have noticed that we indent any elements that are within other elements. 
            This is known as nesting elements.</p>
        <p>When we nest elements within other elements, we create a parent and child relationship between them. 
            The nested elements are the children and the element they are nested within is the parent.</p>
        <p>Just as in human relationships, HTML parent elements can have many children. 
            Elements at the same level of nesting are considered to be siblings.</p>
        <p>The parent, child, and sibling relationships between elements will become much more important 
            later when we start styling our HTML with CSS and adding behavior with JavaScript.</p>
