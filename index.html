<!-- We should always name the HTML file that will contain the homepage of our websites index.html -->
<!--This is because web servers will by default look for an index.html page when users land on our websites - and not having one will cause big problems.-->

<!--Every HTML page starts with a doctype declaration-->
<!--The doctype’s purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the document.-->
<!--The latest version of HTML is HTML5, and the doctype for that version is the following -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--After we declare the doctype, we need to provide an <html> element. 
    This is what’s known as the root element of the document, meaning that every other element in the document will be a descendant of it.-->
    
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>My First Webpage</title>
        <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="../favicon.png"> <!--icône qui apparaît dans l'onglet-->
    </head>

    <!--The final element needed to complete the HTML boilerplate is the <body> element. 
    This is where all the content that will be displayed to users will go - the text, images, lists, links, and so on.-->
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome everyone ! This is the biggest heading</h1>
        <h2>This is a heading 2</h2>
        <h3>This is a heading 3</h3>
        <h4>This is a heading 4</h4>
        <h5>This is a heading 5</h5>
        <h6>This is a heading 6</h6>
        <strong>This is a strong element</strong>
        <p>not strong paragraph element |<strong> strong paragraph element </strong>
        <p>This is an <em>emphasised</em> element</p>

    </body>
</html>
