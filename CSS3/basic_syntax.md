*{
    color:purple;
}

A **type selector** (or element selector) will select all elements of the given element type, 
and the syntax is just the name of the element:

div {
  color: white;
}

**Class selectors** will select all elements with the given class, which is just an attribute you place on an HTML element. 
Hereâ€™s how you add a class to an HTML tag and select it in CSS:

**index.html**
<div class="alert-text">
